# Assumptions
The script assumes that it is run from the directory where the ALL data resides (no sub folders). No checks are done on the existance of the directories or files.

# How to use the script?
Run the script (run_analysis.R), no parameters are needed. The results are in ´tidy_dataset.txt´

#What if some files are in another location?
All paths to files are defined as variables in the MAIN section of the script, you can change them there.
